# Create seeder for CodeIgniter 3 from already existing table.

#### Inspired from [orangehill/iseed](https://github.com/orangehill/iseed) laravel.

- The library seeder is `application/libraries/Seeder.php`. This must be loaded on your controller.

- The example controller is `application/controllers/App.php`.

- How to use: `php index.php <your controller name> <your function name> "tablename"`.
```
cd c:/xampp/htdocs/codeigniter && php index.php app seed "tablename"
```
